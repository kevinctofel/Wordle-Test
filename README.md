# Wordle-Test

Eventual goal is to retrieve Tweets with Wordle scores for a "Wordle Golf" match over 18 days. 18 days = 18 holes.

- First test used Dave Winer's Drummer tool and Twitter verbs to get tweets from two Wordle Golf players.
- Manually exported last 200 tweets of both users to an OPML file.
- Next step is to parse through the tweets to find Wordle scores for each day/hole.
- Using that data, populate a web-based Wordle Golf "scorecard" for both users.
